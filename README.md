# E-Commerce Data Analysis with R Programming <br>
Hello Data Enthusiast!! In this repository i want to share my analytical process of a data analytic project. For you that new to data analysis and visualization, you can learn completely from start to end. If you are a professional or recruiter, this is intended to show my skills and expertise. Please review and give me an insight too. <br>
This repository contains :
1. README (this file), a introduction and explanation about this project.
2. Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), tools to test my code and show visual result of data visualization.
3. Dataset (.csv), data used in this project.
4. Presentaion (.pdf), a file that present the result. When you do data analysis you have to share the result effectively to stakeholders.

Technology companies, especially in Indonesia, are strugling right now (2024). Tech companies which is mostly a start up, facing a challange to increase profitabiity. Same as E-Commerce, such as Bukalapak and Tokopedia which have already listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange, still make loss and their stock price decline continuously.<br>
In my opinion, E-Commerce has many unefficient cost that come from : <br>
  - Massive Discount and Promotion
  - High-cost on human resource
<br>
At early, investors gave funds easily so E-Commerce use it to compete making new user to their platform with discount etc. That called Cheap Money Era. Seeing that E-Commerce and other tech company strugle to get profit from their bussines, excitement to invest in those company declining. E-Commerce nurtured by situation to efficient their cost.
<br>
I excited and have concern on discount strategy because in my opinion the strategy doesnt has effective impact. Common objectives giving discount is to increase user, retent user, make user rely to platform which are intend to increase profit. Consider that most E-Commerce doesnt profit, i estimate that discount is the main cost of E-Commerce operation but doesnt give impact. Our hypothesis, there is a impactfull discount and other doesnt.
<br>
From backgound story above, i am eager to make a case study analysing E-Commerce data to get understanding about current strategy. So in this case we will explore and make conclusion from data.
